The following is an experiment of the running time of three algorithms to find the median of a vector. The first algorithm is Random QuickSort followed by a selection of the [n/2] (position of the median) item in the vector. The second algorithm is Random QuickSelect aiming for the [n/2] (position of the median) item in the vector. The third and last algorithm is RMedian, a randomized algorithm to find the median.

Although the research that led into this project has been thoroughly performed, it is important to note that this is a 1st Semester Course and there is ample room for improvement. For the most part, this is a introductory project.
